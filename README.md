# Project: Fullstack Coding Cube

## Description of the project
This is a full-stack web application that allows a user to input a string to be encoded or decoded using a cryptographic algorithm. The logic for the encoding and decoding is implemented in the backend using NestJS. The frontend is built using Angular and utilizes PrimeNG and PrimeFlex as UI frameworks. The app uses a RESTful API to communicate between the frontend and backend.

## What I learned
In building this project, I learned how to use NestJS to build a RESTful API for handling HTTP requests and responses. I also learned how to use Angular to build the frontend of the application, including how to make HTTP requests to the backend API and update the UI based on the responses. Additionally, I gained experience in utilizing PrimeNG and PrimeFlex as UI frameworks.

## User stories
* As a user, I want to input a string to be encoded using a cryptographic algorithm.
* As a user, I want to input a string to be decoded using a cryptographic algorithm.
* As a user, I want to see the result of the encoding or decoding process displayed on the screen.

## Features
* **User input validation**: The app ensures that user input is valid before encoding or decoding the input.
* **Encoding and decoding**: The app can encode and decode input strings using a cryptographic algorithm.
* **RESTful API**: The app uses a RESTful API to communicate between the frontend and backend.
* **Responsive UI**: The UI is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices.
